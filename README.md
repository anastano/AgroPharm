# AgroPharm - Agricultural Pharmacy Information System

This project is a web application designed as a centralized information system for the sale and purchase of agricultural products, offering delivery options. The system's main goal is to increase product availability for agricultural producers and expand the market reach of the agricultural pharmacy.

In addition to facilitating online sales, the system carefully manages purchases, orders, and product inventory. The entire project, from defining functional requirements to database design and full implementation, was developed individually. This includes designing the database structure and implementing all key features using Spring Boot for the backend, Angular for the frontend, and PostgreSQL for the database.

Special attention was given to ensuring ease of navigation and a clear interface, considering the needs of different user roles and their familiarity with technology. The goal was to provide an intuitive experience for clients, sellers, deliverers and administrators alike.
